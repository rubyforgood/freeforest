# Free Forest School

What if kids could learn while playing outdoors? They can! Research shows unstructured play is greatly beneficial to children's development. Free Forest School organizes local chapters to support children explore and learn while outdoors.

Our project will help parents and teachers (or maybe even kids!) find Free Forest School service areas wherever they might be. We're going to use Mapbox, so if you've ever wanted to learn some GIS work with your Rails and/or JavaScript, or played hooky to be in the great outdoors, this project is for you!
